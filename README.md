# Simple Meeting Notes Search Engine

Quite a simple search engine that I made v quickly, to search through the deluge of .txt notes I create at work. Creates an inverted index to map keywords to relevant files.

Wrote this a year ago, just uploading it now in case I want to come back and improve it later.

Todo: originally planned on writing a simple stemmer, but never got round to it...
